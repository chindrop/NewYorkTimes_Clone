            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and
            a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the
            world of known physics.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in
            the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch
            in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that
            exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously
            violent instant.
        </p>
        <p>
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and
            not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
            Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the
            Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes
            at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
            Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> —
            the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth
            of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr.
            Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
